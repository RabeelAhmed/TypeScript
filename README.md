Interfaces
The interface examples show how to define custom object structures in TypeScript and enforce type checking at compile time.

Extended Interfaces
This example demonstrates interface inheritance, where one interface extends another, adding more properties to the original structure.

Type Aliases
Type aliases provide a way to create custom types, either simple or union types. These examples cover creating aliases for primitive types as well as combining multiple types.

Intersection Types
Intersection types combine multiple types into one, ensuring the final type includes all properties from the involved types.

Classes & Objects
The class and object examples include creating objects with constructors, getters and setters, static members, and even method overloading to add more functionality.

Getters and Setters
These examples highlight how to control access to object properties using getters and setters in TypeScript classes.

Static Members in Classes
Static members allow you to define properties and methods that belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class.

Function Overloading
Shows how to implement function overloading in TypeScript to define multiple function signatures with varying parameters.

Generics
The examples cover how to create reusable code with generics, allowing you to work with types flexibly and efficiently.

Type Guards & Narrowing
Type guards help check and narrow down the types during runtime, ensuring code correctness based on the types passed.

Instanceof
The instanceof operator is used to check object types at runtime, useful when working with class instances to perform type-specific operations.

Concepts Covered
This repository is a collection of TypeScript code snippets that cover key concepts such as:

Interfaces: Create custom types for objects and functions.
Type Aliases: Shorten complex types and combine types.
Classes: Work with constructors, getters/setters, static members, and function overloading.
Generics: Make reusable functions, interfaces, and classes.
Type Guards: Ensure runtime type safety.
Instanceof: Identify instances of classes at runtime.
